[Lexicon of Canadian Geological Names on-line (Weblex Canada)](https://weblex.canada.ca/WeblexNet4/weblex_e.aspx) provides a lithostratigraphy of Canada (and associated references) and a more general chronostrat search. This site provides information about over 16,000 published geological names used in Canada. The names are from several sources, now stored in a single database. The names are of two types: lithological units and chronological units. The lexicon is a "living" database; some names remain to be added, others are incompletely described, and many descriptions require updating. Weblex Canada is supported by Natural Resources Canada, a government agency.
