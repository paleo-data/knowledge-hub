[Latimer Core](https://ltc.tdwg.org) is a data standard for describing collections, and is designed to support the representation and discovery of groups of items. Classes and their properties aim to represent information that describes these groups of things in enough detail to inform deeper discovery of the resources they contain. Scale is flexibleâ€“could be used by an entire institution, or by one collection. Standard is newly ratified, so not implemented widely yet. Data management is a challenge for implementation as most CMS are not really designed to handle this data structure yet.
