From Website: The [Geobiodiversity Database (GBDB)](www.geobiodiversity.com/home), is an integrated system for the management and analysis of stratigraphic and paleontological information. Its goal is to facilitate regional and global scientific collaborations focused on regional and global correlation, quantitative stratigraphy, systematics, biodiversity dynamics, paleogeography, and paleoecology. It is unique among global, public access databases in that it is a section-based online database system, incorporating data from a wide range of disciplines of stratigraphy and paleontology, with inherent interrelationship between different kinds of data sets. Several Windows-based visualization and analysis applications, either fully integrated with the database or supported by subset-export functions, have been developed to make the database more useful as a scientific and educational tool. The GBDB became the formal database of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) in August 2012 at the 34th International Geological Congress in Brisbane, and will produce comprehensive and authoritative web-based stratigraphic information service for global geoscientists, educators and the public. http://geobiodiversity.com/about/people

​​Established in 2012, it is based at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology (NIGP). https://stratigraphy.org/gbdb

## Coverage and gaps

GBDB appears to largely cover China and the United Kingdom and does not have global coverage. Taxonomic coverage also appears limited.
