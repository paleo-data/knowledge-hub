[GRSciColl](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/) is a worldwide catalogue of scientific collections maintained by GBIF, supported by a community comprised of national editors and representatives from registered institutions who keep the information up to date. Any user can suggest updates, additions or mergers of records, prompting editors to review the proposed changes. “Collection descriptors” make it possible to add tabular data to collection metadata records, and data following Latimer Core will be searchable. Can include descriptors about collections outside the scope of GBIF occurrence records (e.g. minerals). Learn more about collection descriptors at https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/grscicoll-collection-descriptors.
