This is a simple implementation of a tooltip for resources, for example, {% include resource_link filename='krimmel-2022-workflows.yml' %}. The tooltip is an include widget that uses the filename to identify the specific resource.

The original annotation for {% include resource_link filename='bauer-et-al-2022.yml' %} included a link, which breaks the tooltip. This annotation is also kind of long. Long tooltips may be cut off.
