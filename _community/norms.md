We act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, and diverse community.

By participating in the Paleo Data Working Group (PDWG), you are expected to make engagement in this community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expectations

PDWG participants are expected to:

- Treat others with dignity and respect.
- Conduct themselves in a professional manner.
- Communicate verbally and nonverbally with civility.
- Be accountable for their actions, words, and decisions.
- Consider the experiences and opportunities that influence your colleagues’ perspectives.
- Make space to allow others to share their perspectives and experiences.
- Endeavor to always approach others with empathy and collegiality.
- Honor the roles and responsibilities of all participants, valuing the contributions of all.
- Refrain from practicing, inciting, encouraging, or condoning inappropriate conduct.

Examples of inappropriate conduct include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.

## Scope

These norms apply within all PDWG community spaces and related interactions, including but not limited to in-person events (e.g. conference meet-ups, workshops), virtual meetings (e.g. Happy Hours), asynchronous communication platforms (e.g. Slack, Google Groups), and shared workspaces (e.g. Google Drive, GitHub). 

## Recourse
If you have an experience at odds with these norms, you may seek resolution by contacting the <a href="{{ '/community/about-pdwg' | relative_url }}">PDWG Organizing Team</a> at paleodatawg@gmail.com. To the extent feasible, the Organizing Team will take appropriate and fair action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. The Organizing Team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with the PDWG Community Norms.
