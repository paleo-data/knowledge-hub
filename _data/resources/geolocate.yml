title: GEOLocate
annotation: Software designed to georeference natural history collections data by interpreting locality data and converting them into specific geospatial coordinate pairs, including an estimate of precision based on the point-radius method. GeoLocate may be downloaded as a standalone desktop application, used via a web-based interface, or run as a web service against an existing online database. It is integrated into Symbiota, Arctos, and other CMS.
