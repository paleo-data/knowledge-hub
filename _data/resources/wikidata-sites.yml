title: Using wikidata to capture and share information about paleontological collecting sites
annotation: Website with materials related to a workshop exploring the possibility of using Wikidata to curate community knowledge about paleontological collecting sites. Participants began by defining the information needs regarding paleontological collecting sites, including flagging aspects of the data that may be problematic to share publicly. They then assessed how these information needs could, or could not, fit into a Wikidata model.
