title: 'Guidelines for Using Wikidata to Mobilize Information about People in Collections: A Paleontology Perspective'
annotation: The purpose of this document is to provide a framework for how to mobilize information via Wikidata about people working in and/or associated with scientific collections. Building on previous Wikidata documentation produced by Siobhan Leachman (2020, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4724139) participants of the Using Wikidata to Capture and Share Information about People in Paleontology workshop (held March 29-31, 2022) created this framework to formalize and share practical knowledge gained from the workshop.
