title: World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS)
annotation: Useful for higher taxonomy. WoRMS is a dynamic database with many editors and daily updates. Some  information is conflicting, and it includes unpublished taxonomic checklists for groups not critically evaluated in literature. Sometimes there is a lack of transparency in which publications/unpublished checklists are relied upon. This is a good source for taxonomic trees that overlap with extant groups.
