title: A Guide to the Fossil Footprints of the World
annotation: Useful for determining ichnotaxonomy of fossil tracks and trackways, as well as the higher taxonomy of the possible track maker. This is a fairly general book, meant for a broad public audience rather than a scientific one. However, it does contain references to other manuscripts, which can then be used for deeper research.
